Hello, Iâ€™m Aidan :)

<br>

I study computer science at UC Berkeley. 


I live in Indiana when I'm not at school, but am currently doing a semester abroad in Copenhagen. I grew up in the Indianapolis, Shanghai and Vienna, and picked up a few (spoken) languages along the way. In my free time I like to run, bike, read and spend quality time with friends. 


Post graduation plans are still uncertain.


Email me at [asalzmann@berkeley.edu](mailto:asalzmann@berkeley.edu), find my professional background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidansalzmann/ target="_blank), or take a look at my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/asalzmann).
